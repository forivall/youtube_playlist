# Youtube Playlist
A bookmarklet that scans a page for all youtube links, and plays them back
to back in a player over the page.


# Installing
Simply drag this bookmark to your bookmarks bar:
[Play Videos](javascript:(function(\)%7Bvar%20a=document.createElement(%22script%22\);a.type=%22text/javascript%22;a.src=%22//github.com/zaius/Youtube-Playlist/raw/master/youtube_playlist.min.js%22;document.getElementsByTagName(%22head%22\)[0].appendChild(a\)%7D\)(\);)


[Here's the page I built it for](http://www.reddit.com/r/electrohouse).
But that might not be your cup of tea, so
[here's a page with videos of cute animals](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/)
