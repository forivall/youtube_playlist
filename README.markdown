# Youtube Playlist
A bookmarklet that scans a page for all youtube links, and plays them back
to back in a player over the page.


# Installing
Github doesn't let me put a javascript link here, so you'll have to visit
[this page](http://zaius.github.com/Youtube-Playlist) to install and test out
the bookmarklet.
